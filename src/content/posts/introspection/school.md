# Stop relying on school to build a career.
## The issue
A lot of people actually don't think by themselves. Their opinions, habits but more importantly their identity is derived from their environment.<br />
When it comes to "finding a path" in life, (like we are teached), they feel lost; at every new cycle of their lives they have to go through a chapter of doubting and/or identity crisis.

## What we're teached
To set things clear! **School give you tools** !<br />
Tools to help you navigate towards a goal you defined yourself.<br />
This looks like a simple stupid point. The thing is, no one will teach you that. Schools purpose has always been to "**help you** navigate through life", but never **to navigate you** through life.

## Let me explain myself
Businesses today and in the past have always came down to one unique principle:
> Solve a problem.

In todays world all these big companies like google, etc. have so much money, they can basically do what they want and they are at an industrializing state.
- Their point is to make **more money**; using it to solve more problems.
- They make more money by selling things, products and no more solutions (industrialization).

## There comes a moral and ethical problem
The point to make money to make profit to solve problems is that they have to market it to sell it to a mass of people.
> The problem they then want to solve with that money can be questionnable.
> The marketing employed to bombard people with their strategies is questionnable.

These points are actually shaping your environment like we said earlier. Replacing your natural decisions and opinions with driven paths overflowing you with delighters.

## Lost generations and Loosing Impact Control
We don't know "what we want to do in life".<br />
:::important[]
What kind of nonesense is this ?
:::

> When, or where have you ever felt the need to find something to make sense of your life ?
> When or where have you ever felt the need to create a big company other than for money ?

We are driven towards options society enforces us to stare at. Yet no member of that parade is wise enough to conclude that they have been following another peoples (actually companies) perspectives.<br />

People are loosing themselves in choices and product opportunities that have been put there exactly for them to use. And all companies care about (that situation) is to build metrics and performance indicators 🙄.

## Kindness and Money
It has never been about choosing in what company you want to work for. It has always been about caring towards something that you feel you can help with.
> If you have parents that allow you to study, allow yourself to take that time to build something you feel proud of for the impact it delivers on a real issue for a group of people.
> If you don't have money, you have to work and follow the paths and opportunities given to you until you can be financially stable enough to start making your own choices again.
> If you have enough money. Live. Stop chasing the mermaids of industrialization. Start looking around, meet people, help them, big, little, it doesn't matter.
> What you give that benefits others, make their situation better, leads into connection and helping you. What you give, comes back at you.
