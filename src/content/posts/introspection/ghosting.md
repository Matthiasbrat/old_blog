# Ghosting

Ghosting is the absence of a response to any interaction initiated by a person.<br />
Ghosting seems to be the new trend in modern days, but why is that ?<br />
> In a world of overstimulation and continuous information delivered by social media and any technological devices, where stays the place of life ?

## Symptoms

Life has always been something very static. It doesn't move like we would want it or think to.<br />
We move fast. Humanity really has advanced on a technological perspective in the last century. Although at what cost ?<br />
> The dawn of curiosity mentions being the appendix of our culture.
Will this discovery induce an end to a more intelligent and sharing education of future generations ? Or are we participating in a desensitization to every individual household, life ?

## Shelter

As stated before; I believe the advancement of life is a personal perspective. Every individual has it's own sensitivity to the past and future. Every individual has his experience of life.
> Respecting one's experience and **timing** perspective of when and what to do is an empathic value.
<br/>
We all move at different paces. Acknowledging this helps easing our own demands frustration.

## Being

Ghosting is not an insult nor a lack of respect. It's a humane reaction to an overstimulated mind, a call for fresh air when we suffocate; taking back control of our own timeline and infusing logic, sense, experience and rest; wisdom.

## Normality
Being educated to this behavior will by default become part of our evolution over time. As reactions rules, ghosting dilutes.
