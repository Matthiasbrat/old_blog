# Ghosting

Ghosting is the absence of a response to any interaction initiated by a person.<br />
Ghosting seems to be the new trend in modern days, but why is that ?<br />
> In a world of overstimulation and continuous information delivered by social media and any technological devices, where stays the essence of life ?

## Symptoms

Life has always been something very static. It doesn't move like we would want it to or think.<br />
We move fast. Humanity has made significant advancements in technology over the last century. Although, at what cost ?<br />
> The dawn of curiosity mentions being the appendix of our culture.
Will this discovery induce an end to a more intelligent and sharing education of future generations ? Or are we participating in a desensitization to every individual household's, life ?

## Shelter

As stated before, the advancement of life is a personal perspective. Every individual has its own sensitivity to the past and future. Every individual has his experience of life.
> Valuing someoneâ€™s **experience** and **timing** is an act of empathy.  

We all move at different paces. Acknowledging this helps ease our own demands' frustration.

## Being

Ghosting is not an insult nor a lack of respect. It's a natural response to an overstimulated mind. We crave fresh air when suffocated. It's about regaining control of our time, bring in logic, sense, experience, and rest; wisdom.

## Normality
Being educated to this behavior will, by default, become part of our evolution over time. As reactions rule, ghosting dilutes.
