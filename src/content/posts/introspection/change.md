I'm willing to change. I have stuck to the same state of mind for my whole life now.<br/>
But emotional blackmail is making me willing to change. Here's why.

# My current state of mind
> I stick to my true self, don't fake or change my **identity** for others.

# Why ?
I've been through a lot. After much introspection and study of modern anthropology, I understand today's behaviors. I'm distant about the feelings people project onto you and themselves.

I'm very aware of my situation and my impact on one's thinking. I like to keep a chill vibe, a non reacting attitude to make sure the interlocutor doesn't feel judged or diminished.

# Why wasn't I allowing me to change ?
I know I had opportunities to become someone more **accepting**. But, I didn't allow myself to follow that path for these reasons:

+ I want to be my true self in any situation and answer from that perspective.
+ I feel like not being honest with my interlocutor when I have to adapt my true self.
+ I have to choose the right words and wait for the appropriate time to express them.

# Why is that a problem ?
Now, with time, I realise that some close relationships can't make sense. I mean any interaction with someone can be such that you have to make sure the other person is happy. Even when that person is actually making you suffer.

The thing is, that person can be emotionally holding on to you. And you can feel like you musn't keep that person around you in your life. But somehow, keeping that person around could actually fill a certain role in your life. Even with hate, anger, suffering, batteling...

+ The point is that sometimes saying, "yes" can be hard because that's not how things happened.<br/>
+ For example: If someone hits you with a brick and asks you if you felt pain, saying "no" takes a lot of self-control. Of course, everyone should say "yes".<br/> But the whole point of this article is to talk about poeple who won't allow that.

# Change ?

Of course one would say that this looks like some sort of masochism. Letting someone beat you and saying you're fine, because you have no choice (life-changing repercussions otherwise), despite your suffering. Believe me or not, some people like that exist; it is hard to live with that's why I come up with a piece of solution.

> It is not about changing your true self, it's about adapting, **develop another personality**.</br>
> It's about dissociating from affection directed at you, by letting another part of yourself live with it.
>
> I am aware and sensitive to the context of conversations. I prefer to say what a person doing <abbr title="Emotional Blackimail">EB</abbr> would want to hear to ease the relationship, rather than sticking to myself, expressing my feelings, and suffering from their toxic manners.


# Is it worth it !?

Well, that's the thing. I've always been quite against living as someone I'm not. But I'm willing to try a compromise now. **Everyone has its own opinion on your personality.** But, allowing yourself to progress towards these different shapes of yourself rather than sticking to one, might allow us to evolve a little more.

# That's it ü•îüç†‚òï
