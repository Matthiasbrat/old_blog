Never have I begged for more than sufficience.<br />
I've always enjoyed life as it is. The sun, the clouds, the rain. People making friends here and then.<br />

People have a lot to think about nowadays. I'm more of a looking person. I see.....<br />

I think that's what a lot of soul singer call love.<br />
This well being and calmness all around us. The way we look through the window and feel part of this world. How the slow moving clouds shows us the fast moving perspective of life, is just a perspective.<br />

Greatness, and other people's dreams.. Don't get blown away by the wind of other people's dreams.<br />
If you let your feet decide where they lead you, then let destiny be your shoes.<br />Going barefoot is a painfull choice.

Sometimes, a slow walk in the park is not what you need. But the sound of the wind, the light of the sun, the reminiscence of past walks with someone you were pleased to walk with. It's calling you for a moment far away from your screen. You might, sing, laugh, eat on the way. And that'll be what you remember of yesterday and consistently bring you up to tomorrow.<br />

Every step you take, is a promise of who you are. Let your feet lead you back, before perspective changed you; where you left the track, for another man's life.
